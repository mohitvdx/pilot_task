#Pilot task

##Goal

1.   Comparing **mxnet-gluon** backend on **resnet18_v1, resnet18_v2** and **resnet34_v1** architecture using the given dataset.
2.   Steps

      - Installing Monk.
      - Loading the dataset.
      - Importing **mxnet-gluon**.
      - Training model using **resnet18_v1** architecture.
      - Training model using **resnet18_v2** architecture.
      - Training model using **resnet34_v1** architecture.
      - Comparing the above models using the **comparison** class of Monk for training accuracy, validation accuracy, training loss, validation loss, time taken in training and GPU usage.
